	<h2 style="color:#869a61">Research Gap</h2>
	</br>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of text-based sentiment analysis and emotion recognition, current research has achieved substantial advancements. However, there is a research vacuum in establishing all-encompassing strategies that use verbal, aural, and visual data for sentiment analysis. Despite recent advancements like the MF-BERT model, there is still work to be done in order to better understand the time dependent interactions between different modalities and to recognize emotions more precisely and with context.
    Most of the testing and development of stress detection equipment has taken place in carefully monitored lab environments. There are still research gaps in the creation of reliable and non-intrusive stress detection techniques for real-world situations employing cellphones and wearable sensors. By overcoming these obstacles, highly accurate systems that track users' stress levels and provide real-time stress management will be developed. Although wearable technology has the capacity to track and identify human emotions, there is still a research gap that prevents this technology from being more publicly available and usable. 
    Research should concentrate on creating effective systems, such as the one that uses heart rate information from smart wristbands, to track users' emotional states in real-time without a lot of disruption.
    Although there are algorithms for identifying facial expressions, they might be improved to accurately identify a wider range of emotions. Existing systems mostly concentrate on a small number of emotions, including joy, sorrow, surprise, fear, disgust, and rage. Future studies may improve the capability to identify and categorize a greater variety of facial emotions, producing more accurate and nuanced findings. Research is still being done on how to recognize emotions in social media, particularly on sites like Facebook. There is opportunity for more sophisticated strategies that take into account complicated emotional states 
    and the environment in which they are manifested in addition to the existing methods' primary focus on recognizing fundamental emotions. There are several uses for developing algorithms that can properly recognize and classify emotions from user comments in marketing, sentiment analysis, and user experience enhancement.
